hey im cam. im from the sunny side of southern california. it was pretty nice growing up there. The sunshine kept me outside, especially during those long summer months. spending time outside  allowed me to explore my passion for observation. that observation turned into a love for photography. there is a sense of stillness in observation. i like to try and capture that stillness in my photos. you know everything is moving so fast it’s pretty hard to find a moment of stillness. i guess you can even describe it as simplistic. everything can get so complicated. I want to create something simple. simple and quiet. i thrive in those lonescapes so many of us try to ignore. going out and observing people and scenes, i would see that everything has something worth saying. through this came the idea of an interview. the interviews i have taken are different in that the answers are photos. in this way these answers are subjective. i want personal context to drive the image. i am a student out at emerson college. i am just out here trying to capture those rays of sunshine as best i can. through my lens. i work primarily with film. it has a more sunny feel to it. my dream isn’t anything spectacular. my dream is to create a livelihood of doing what i love. photography and making art.
