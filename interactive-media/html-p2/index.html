        <p><br><s>hey im cam.</s><br> 
        <em>im from southern california. it was pretty nice growing up there.
        the sunshine kept me outside.
        spending time outside &nbsp;allowed me to explore my passion for observation.
        that observation turned into a love for photography.</p></em> 
		<p><br><s>there is a sense of stillness in observation.<br></s>
        <em>you know everything is moving so fast it’s pretty hard to find a moment of stillness.
        everything can get so complicated. 
        I want to create something simple. simple and quiet.</p></em>
		<p><br><s>i am a visual media arts student at emerson college.<br></s>
        <em>i am trying to capture those rays of sunshine as best i can. 
        through my lens.
        i work primarily with film.
        my dream isn’t anything spectacular. my dream is to create a livelihood of doing what i love. observing and creating.</p></em>
